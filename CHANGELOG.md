## 0.8.1

- [General] Enhancements.

If you encounter any issues, make sure to fully clean your project and rebuild it.

### Needs attention:

- Make sure you have one of the followng Node.js versions installed:

  - v20.19 or higher
  - v22.12 or higher
  - v23.4 or higher

- If you are using [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and encountering issues, update your Jest configuration (likely found in your package.json or any jest.config.\* file) with the following:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ... The rest of your configuration

## 0.8.0

- [Apple Pay] Support Apple Pay tokenization (`saveCard` field).

## 0.7.0

- [Samsung Pay] Support Samsung Pay feature.
- [General] Support customizing merchant's country code.
- [General] Support `givenId` feature.
- [Credit Card Token Fix] Always enforce the `saveOnly` field as `true` in the `TokenRequest` class, and remove it from the public SDK API.
- [General] Enhancements.

If you encounter any issues, make sure to clean your project and rebuild it.

### Required changes (only if consuming the `TokenRequest` class directly):

If you are utilizing the `TokenRequest` class directly, change the following:

- If you supplied `saveOnly` parameter as `true`. Remove it since now it will be always true in this context.
- If you didn't supply the `saveOnly` parameter (or made it `false`). Switch to using the `PaymentRequest` class with the `CreditCardRequestSource` class and set the `tokenizeCard` option to `true`. It will achieve the same result.

### Needs attention:

- Supply the `merchantCountryCode` field in the `PaymentConfig` to indicate your merchantâ€™s principle place of business. Previously, this was based on the currency, which was less precise. Now, you should explicitly set this code for accurate payment processing (defaults to SA).
- Supply the `givenId` field in the `PaymentConfig` object to support [Idempotency](https://docs.moyasar.com/api/idempotency).
- Check [Installation](https://docs.moyasar.com/sdk/react-native/installation) and [Basic Integration](https://docs.moyasar.com/sdk/react-native/basic-integration) documents to support and configure Samsung Pay.
